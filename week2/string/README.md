Welcome to the readme for the projects under the Strings topic in the Harvard CS50 course!

This topic covers the basics of working with strings in C, including string manipulation functions and the importance of null-terminated strings.

Here is a brief overview of the projects in this topic:

Hello: This project is an introduction to C programming and the CS50 IDE. You will be prompted to enter your name, and the program will print "hello, [your name]" to the console.

Initials: In this project, you will be given a string of text and will need to output the initials of each word in uppercase letters.

Caesar: This project is an implementation of a Caesar cipher, which is a simple encryption technique. The program takes in a plaintext message and a key, and outputs the ciphertext message.

Vigenere: Similar to the Caesar project, this program implements the Vigenere cipher, which is a more advanced encryption technique. The program takes in a plaintext message and a key, and outputs the ciphertext message.

Crack: In this project, you will be given a hashed password and will need to crack it using a brute force algorithm to find the original plaintext password.

Each project comes with its own set of instructions and specifications, so be sure to read them carefully before starting.

Good luck and have fun learning about strings in C!
